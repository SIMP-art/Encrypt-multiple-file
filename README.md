# Encrypt-multiple-file
Just one of my useless project, It's 256bit key AES-CTR mode file encryption that's using via command line
# build
```sh
go build main.go
```
# usage
you can use number 1 and 2 as encrypt and decrypt...
key can be any length but longer is better isn't it? (my key parser algorithm is kinda bad)
```sh
main.exe <encrypt[1]/decrypt[2]> <key> <file1> [file2] [file3] ...
```
maybe I will update better file/dir encryption if this project has peoples interest.
